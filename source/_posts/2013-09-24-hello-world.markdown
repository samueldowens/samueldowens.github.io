It’s been one day and I can already tell this is going to be a period of weeks that defines my future. The first day of class 003 and the first day in the new Flatiron campus was an amazing experience. A giant space filled with like-minded nerds and geeks from all different backgrounds coming together to code for an intense amount of time.

The best part? At the end of a long-day it hadn’t become a grind. I was laughing just as much when we wrapped up as when we started and wished the staff had let us go a little further as I was really digging into cleaning up the CSS in our project.


I can’t wait to see what the next 12 weeks hold.
