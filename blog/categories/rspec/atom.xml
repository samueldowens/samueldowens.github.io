    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Todays post is going to be short. I&rsquo;m going to write down some thoughts about RSpec and writing tests.</p>

<p>Write out what you want your tests to do without worrying about the actual syntax for the tests first.
Statements like &ldquo;it &lsquo;should do whatever this test should do&rsquo;&rdquo; do can be followed with pending on the next line.
This allows you to write out all of the ideas with what you would like your code to do without having to worry about any syntax yet.
You can then impliment tests as you&rsquo;re comfortable and write the corresponding code to pass them when the tests are ready.</p>

<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s helpful to write out skeleton tests, to describe what features a given unit of work should DEFINITELY have without
worrying too much about potential features or tasks that it may need further down the line. Once you get the basics built out on
your files when you come across new functionality that is needed you can go back and add tests and then add the code to get those to pass.
This approach can save some time as you won&rsquo;t need to try and brainstorm every feature you might come across and can instead focus on making
sure your tests are good and that your code passes them. <strong>You can always add more tests later</strong></p>

<p>With the level of complexity of our current projects, writing tests often feels very frustrating. It feels like spending a lot of time writing out
very basic things about the code when we could be actually writing the program. Intellectually I&rsquo;m aware that this work will pay off down the line as projects become
more complex, so in the meantime I need to keep reminding myself that it&rsquo;s not slowing us down, it&rsquo;s preparing us for things to come.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Weekend two was a lot of fun. I managed to end up pretty comfortable with SQL pretty early in the day and we moved onto some other new and interesting things later.</p>

<p>Namely Nokogiri, this ruby gem for scraping web pages was the big learning focus of my weekend. Our project was to use Nokogiri to scrape the Flatiron student webpage for information on each student and export that data into an SQL database. It took a lot of trial and error playing around with Nokogiri before we figured things out, but by the end my whole group was pretty comfortable navigating the trees of data that is HTML.</p>

<p>We also had to redo the quiz from week one but make it object oriented, having to have classes in each of the previous tests. I thought the difficulty on that assignment was pretty easy but that it was useful in providing repetition in looking at grouping things as a class.</p>

<p>Lastly we were given an assignment called playlister, which was a multi-file, multi-class assignment that had a suite of rspec tests that needed to be passed. I sure hope this was the stretch assignment for the weekend as I spent a lot of time struggling with it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really looking forward to week three. After two weeks I&rsquo;m already amazed at the tools we&rsquo;re beginning to scratch the surface of using. I can&rsquo;t imagine after 10 more weeks how many cool things we&rsquo;ll be able to build. I feel like a child who just learned what a car can do but whose feet can&rsquo;t yet reach the pedals. Once they can it&rsquo;s going to be a fun time!</p>
