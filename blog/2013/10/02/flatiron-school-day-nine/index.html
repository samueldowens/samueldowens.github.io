<p>Week two day two was a rough one for me. I&rsquo;m finally starting to feel really stressed by the material. I&rsquo;m spending a lot more time fighting my way through producing what I feel is sub-par code than I&rsquo;d like. I&rsquo;m really hoping that I&rsquo;m reaching the end of a plateau in my learning and will take a jump forward soon. I&rsquo;m having trouble breaking problems down into smaller pieces and still keeping track of everything. I&rsquo;m also having some issues figuring out how to refactor my code from the &lsquo;works&rsquo; stage to the &lsquo;right&rsquo; stage. Week 2 day 3 we get a big chunk of time to catch up on stuff though, so I&rsquo;m hoping that my not feeling confident about my code from the last day or two isn&rsquo;t uncommon and that I come out of Wednesday feeling a bit better.</p>
